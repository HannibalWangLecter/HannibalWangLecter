### I'm Hao Wang :cn: !

- :wink::mortar_board:   Hao Wang, M.E. Candidate, is the postgraduate student of Computer Applied Technology. He is with the [State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research](http://brain.bnu.edu.cn/) at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/). Wang holds a B.E. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://ci.ahnu.edu.cn/) from [Anhui Normal University](http://www.ahnu.edu.cn/)  (2014-2018),  and has been on postgraduate student at [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) since then. 
- :eyes::key: Wang is a member of Li's BCI Lab (Brain-Computer-Interface), which aim to help restore lost motor function to people with paralysis. Our research focus on Brain-computer interface technology and related neuroscience issues, including real-time decoding algorithms for motor cortex neural signals. In our lab, we use `Plexon Omniplex` to record  Macaque's neural signal and decode its motor intention on the computer screen.  
- :sweat_smile::high_brightness: Iâ€™m the author of [NeuroRA](https://zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/) and [PyCTRSA](https://github.com/ZitongLu1996/PyCTRSA) - Two Python toolboxes for representational analysis.
- :e-mail::mailbox_with_mail: If you have any question about my projects, you can email me: [Hao.Wang@mail.bnu.edu.cn](Hao.Wang@mail.bnu.edu.cn) 
- :smiley::bulb: Research Interests: `Data Mining`, `Artificial Intelligence` , `Machine Learning`, `Neural Computation` ,`Control theory`
- :dizzy_face::telescope: Future goals: :one: Explore how motor  c encodes visual information (basic visual features, objects, facial expressions/identities) in visual perception, visual memory and mental imagery. :two: Explore the similar or different representations and connections between biological brain and AI models. :three: How emotion and reward influences different cognitive processes and how our brain represents emotion and reward. :four: Using neuroscience methhods to improve cognitive ability.

### Notes - Finding a cooperator!
- Are you interesting in implementing a Toolbox for neuroscientists and psychologists?
- PyCTRSA will be a simple but helpful Python toolkit for cross-temporal RSA-based decoding for EEG and MEG data.
- This work would be affilliated with [NeuroRA](https:/zitonglu1996.github.io/NeuroRA/), but it is an independent part.
- If you are familiar with PyPlot or any other Python Plotting package and interested in writing documents with me, you can contact me!
- The algorithms in PyCTRSA would be realized by me in several weeks. Hope we can work together and finish this simple project in 1-2 month(s) and maybe we can write an article to submit the journal of open source software (JOSS) at the end!
- If you are interested in this, please email me ([Hao.Wang@mail.bnu.edu.cn](Hao.Wang@mail.bnu.edu.cn))  and we can discuss the prossibilities!
